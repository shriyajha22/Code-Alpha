TASK 1 : CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES

Building a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. Using if-else statements or pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses. This will give us a basic understanding of natural language processing and conversation flow.

TASK 2 : TIC-TAC-TOE GAME

Implementing an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. Using algorithms like Minimax with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player unbeatable. This project will help us understand game theory and basic search algorithms.
